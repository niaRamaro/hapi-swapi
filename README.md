# hapi-swapi
This is a small exercise from https://github.com/KrashStudio/react-exercice.

This project just :
1. Takes in parameters for a search or a detail
2. Query the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.dev/)
3. Format and return the results

The frontend code querying this API can be found [here](https://github.com/niaRamaro/react-swapi-demo) and here is a live [demo](https://niaramaro.github.io/react-swapi-demo/)
